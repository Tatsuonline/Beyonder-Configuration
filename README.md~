# Beyonder Configuration



---

This is just some of the stuff I added to the /etc/update-motd.d files to give our server the ability to strike fear into the hearts of those who dared connect to it.

I named it Beyonder after the famous [comic book character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonder) to emphasize its power. All these little scripts do is provide a random quote every time someone connects to it and it also displays some information about the server.
